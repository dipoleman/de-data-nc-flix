# Additional Tasks

We've had an issue recently with certain customers not looking after the films they're renting from us! Unfortunately there is no data on this and it is making our stock numbers inaccurate.

1. Create a query that updates the `stock` table to include some way of tracking the condition of our rental copies.

2. Create a query that updates all current stock apart from _Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker_ to be **undamaged**.

We've recently received a lot of new funding and we plan to open a number of shops in new locations.

1. Use a query to find the locations with the most customers that **do not** currently have a store. This should be sorted by number of customers (from highest to lowest) in that location.

2. Expand the previous query to automatically create new rows in the `stores` table for the 2 most highly populated areas that do not currently have a store.

3. Create a query that checks the 10 most highly rated films in our database and adds 1 of each film to both of the new stores.
